Mission 1

-Talking with the teacher puts you on top of the school

-You can get stuck in NPC by talking to them

-All characters can push even without skills

-Kids top is not collidable

-Pressing space again will restart the conversation (this is funny however lel)

-After this the game gets stuck-ish?

+Allow the player to read (slighty longer delay, skip to the next text by mashing space etc.)
+Placement of interaction characters (I believe this was noted)
